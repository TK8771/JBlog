**Let's take a random walk down a Random Forest path!**

Scientists have always been looking to explain the world through observations and data. But what has always fascinated me about life, is that randomness, one way or another, will always play its part.

At least that's what I'd like to think Tim Kam Ho, a computer scientist at IBM Watson, had in mind when she first created Random Forest.

This post will cover the basics of the Random Forest model and the concepts that underlie it.

## Decision Trees

A decision tree is a flow-chart-like tree structure, where each internal node represents a test/question on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test/question, and leaf nodes represent different class breakdowns.

Here's an example of a decision tree surrounding a question that I hope I'll be soon considering: "Should I accept a new job offer?"
